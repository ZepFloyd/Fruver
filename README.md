# Fruver - Online commerce and sales management software

This is a web application developed for a fruits and vegetables store. The UI and the code documentation are both presented in spanish, due to it being a requirement for the project.

The application allows customers to sign up and place orders online, which are then delivered to their homes. Customers can also view the status of their orders as they are being prepared for delivery.

The admin/vendor can access several other functionalities, such as:

Customers Module: manage the customer's user accounts.

Products Module: manage the products that are being sold online (stocks, prices, descriptions, images, etc.).

Orders Module: manage customer's orders, allowing updates to the orders' states.

Expenses Module: manage the company's expenses (products, bags, other expenses, etc.).

Reports Module: generate reports on sales by customer or date, and reports on expenses by date.
